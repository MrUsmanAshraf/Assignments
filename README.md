# This is a sample Markdown file.
i am learning Mark down and will practice it here.
1. surround the text with single asterisk or underscore to get you text italic.
    #### For example: 
    *my name is usman ashraf* and _i am learning python_.
2. surround the text with double asterisk or underscore to get you text bold.
    #### For example: 
    **my name is usman ashraf** and __i am learning python__.
3. boldness ad italic can be nested.
    #### For example: 
    **my name is _usman ashraf_** and __i am learning *python*__.
4. surround the text with one or more backticks to make it code.
    #### For example: 
    **my name is `usman` ``ashraf``** and __i am learning ```python```__.
5. surround the text with more than one tildes to strike the text.
    #### For example: 
    my name is ~~usman ashraf~~ and i am learning ~~python~~.
6. surround the text with a single dollar sign to make it a LaTex(Equation).
#### For example: 
$e^{\pi i} + 1 = 0$
<br>$x^2+ 2y^3=3xy$
<br>7. start the lines with greater than sign then space to make it quote.
> always have faith in yourself
> no matter what the circumstances are.
8. surround a block of lines with three backticks to make it a code block.
    #### For Example:
    ```
    print("Hello world")
    sum = a + b
    ```
    we can also specify the coding language.
    ```python
    print("Hello world")
    sum = a + b
    ```
9. start a line with hyphen, plus or asterisk and space after that to make it a bullet and unordered list.
    ####For Example:
    + usman
    + ali
    + ashraf
10.  Start lines with a number followed by a period then a space to make an ordered list. 
     (Numbering is automatic and follows from the first element.)
     #### For Example:
     1. usman
     1. ali
     1. akram
11. Inside a list, include square brackets filled with a space or character (conventionally 'x') to 
create a checklist.
    #### For example:
- [ ] Item 1
- [x] Item 2 (completed)
- [ ] Item 3
- [ ] Item 4
this is not working.
